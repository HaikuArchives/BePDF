<hr>
<p>Mouse Control in BePDF adds a level of grace that users have come to love and expect from Haiku applications.</p>

<h2>Getting Around</h2>
<p>BePDF is intended for use with a three-button mouse, but the <b>Right Mouse Button</b> (RMB) can be simulated by holding down [<b>CTRL</b>] and the <b>Left Mouse Button</b> (LMB). Similarly, the <b>Middle Mouse Button</b> (MMB) may be simulated by holding [<b>SHIFT</b>] while pressing the <b>LMB</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click the <b>LMB</b> over a link to open a new BePDF window for PDF links or launch the default browser for URLs</p></li>
<li><p>Click and hold the <b>LMB</b> over free space to position the document</p></li>
<li><p>Move the <b>Scroll Wheel</b> up or down to scroll within a document</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <b>Left Windows Key</b> and move the <b>Scroll Wheel</b> to scroll several lines within the document</p></li>
<li><p>Press and hold the <b>RMB</b> to create a selection area</p></li></ul>

<h2>Zooming</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Clicking and dragging the <b>MMB</b> allows the user to zoom in on a rectangular selection, but only if the rectangle is sufficiently large. The size constraint is to allow the user to abort the zoom function if a wrong mouse button was pressed.<br>
This feature may also be used to determine the function of a specific mouse button by clicking and holding the mouse button; either a magnifying glass (for zooming) or a pair of scissors (for selecting) will be shown</p></li>
<li><p>Pressing the [<b>CTRL</b>] key while rotating the <b>Scroll Wheel</b> (for users with "scroll wheel mice") will allow the user to zoom in (<b>Scroll Wheel up</b>) and out (<b>Scroll Wheel down</b>) in a document.</p></li></ul>

<h2>Using Selections</h2>
<p>Press [<b>CTRL</b>] and click either the <b>RMB</b> or the <b>LMB</b> to select a rectangular area and copy its contents to the clipboard (both text and bitmaps may be included in the selection). The text can be pasted into any appropriate application. Similarly, the bitmap can pasted into Gobe Productive Graphics or Image Processing parts.</p>

<h2>Dragging and Dropping</h2>
<ul><li><p>Click the <b>LMB</b> on a selection and drag it to a Tracker window to create a text clipping</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>RMB</b> to initiate a drag and drop that allows one to choose a file format (either text or graphics) for the clipping. The type of allowable image formats depends on the [ColorSpace] selected in the BePDF Display Preferences window). A color space setting of 32bpp will result in the best image quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Hold [<b>Shift</b>] and click and drag using the <b>LMB</b> to zoom in on the rectangular selection</p></li></ul>
<p>Please note that if you have configured your mouse in a left-handed configuration then substitute <b>LMB</b> for <b>RMB</b> in the above instructions. Also, when the [<b>CTRL</b>] key is set as the shortcut key in Haiku's Keymap Preferences application, one must substitute [<b>ALT</b>] for [<b>CTRL</b>] when using the BePDF keyboard shortcuts.</p>
